🧾 Restaurant Billing and Management System
This project is a Python-based Restaurant Billing and Management System designed to streamline restaurant operations. It offers both a basic backend interface and a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, depending on user preference or system requirements.

🔧 Project Structure
backend.py
This script contains the core backend functionalities of the system. When executed, it runs in the Python IDLE environment with a simple command-line interface. It is primarily used for managing and testing database operations, calculations, and logic without relying on a graphical interface.

gui.py
This script builds on top of the backend functionalities using Tkinter, Python’s built-in GUI library. It provides a clean, user-friendly graphical interface suitable for actual use in a restaurant setting. The GUI allows staff to perform tasks such as:

Taking orders

Calculating bills

Managing items

Viewing sales or reports

🗃️ Backend Integration
The system is connected to a relational database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL), allowing storage and retrieval of:

Menu items

Orders

Bills

Inventory data

This ensures that data is preserved across sessions and supports future analytics or reporting.

💾 Backup Support
A data backup mechanism is included to prevent data loss and maintain reliability. Regular backups can be scheduled or executed manually.
