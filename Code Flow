📝 Project Flow Explanation: Restaurant Billing and Management System
The flowchart illustrates the structured interaction within the Restaurant Billing and Management System, which is divided into three main modules: Admin Panel, Customer Panel, and Exit.

🔶 1. Start & Main Menu
The system begins at a Start node.

The user is directed to the Main Menu, where they can choose between:

Admin Panel

Customer Panel

Exit

🔷 2. Admin Panel
Upon selecting the Admin Panel, the user is prompted with options to:

Login

Register a new user

Return to Main Menu

On successful login (username and password), the admin can:

Modify Menu

Display Menu

Logout (which leads to end of admin session)

🔶 3. Customer Panel
The Customer Panel prompts the user to:

Login

Return to Main Menu

After entering valid credentials, the customer has options to:

Display Menu

Order Food

Logout

Upon placing an order, the system:

Displays the bill

Exports the data to MySQL database

Then checks:

If user wants to create a new bill, it loops back to order again.

If not, the process ends.

🔴 4. Exit
If the user chooses to Exit from the main menu, the program terminates.

✅ Summary
This flow ensures:

Role-based access for admin and customer.

User authentication before accessing functionalities.

Seamless integration with MySQL for persistent data storage.

A loop-based ordering system allowing multiple bills without restarting the session.

This logical structure makes the system efficient, secure, and user-friendly for real-time restaurant operations.
